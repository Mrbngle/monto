Monto assignment

Here's my solution for the Monto Assignment. 

My goal was to make the solution extensible and scalable.

Data is fetched inside a react hook and can thus be reused in other components 
using a different endpoint.

Sorting algorithms are available from Utilities.tsx, and use generic typing, so they
can be reused to filter arrays with a different data structure inside future components. 

Sorting works on all columns, not just ID. 

I did not spend too much time on layout. 

## How to run
- Clone repos to your hardrive
- Go to directory and, run `npm run dev` using your favourite cli.
